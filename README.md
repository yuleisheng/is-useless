## The Uselessness Algorithmâ„¢

Our highly scientific and not-at-all-made-up algorithm checks for the following signs of true uselessness:

- The file name must contain the word "useless".
- The file must be completely empty.
- The file must have been created on a weekend.

If your file passes these rigorous checks, it will be certified as officially useless.
