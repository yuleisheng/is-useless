# is-useless

A CLI tool to determine if a file is sufficiently useless.

## Is it useless?

Yes.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g is-useless
```

## Usage

### Analyzing a File

To analyze a file and determine its Uselessness Score:
```bash
is-useless <path/to/your/file>
```

### Generating a Useless File

To generate a new, perfectly useless file:
```bash
is-useless generate
```
This will create a new file in your current directory with a name like `useless-file-1678886400000.txt`.

## Useless Sound Effect

To truly enhance the uselessness experience, you can add a sound effect!
Simply place an MP3 file named `useless-sound.mp3` in the root directory of this project.
A sad trombone, a rubber chicken, or a deflating balloon sound is highly recommended.

## The Uselessness Algorithmâ„¢

Our highly scientific and not-at-all-made-up algorithm uses two paths to determine uselessness.

### Path 1: The AI Buzzword Shortcut

A file is **immediately certified useless** if it meets the following criteria:
- The filename contains the word "ai".
- The file's content mentions any of the following: "openai", "anthropic", "gemini", "llama", "deepseek".

### Path 2: The Traditional Uselessness Gauntlet

If the file does not contain AI buzzwords, it must pass the following rigorous checks:

- The file name must contain the word "useless".
- The file must be completely empty or contain only whitespace.
- The file must have been created on a weekend.
- The filename must not contain any vowels (a, e, i, o, u).
- The file must have been created in the last 60 seconds.

If your file passes these checks, it will be certified as officially useless.
